In this GitHub project, I present an in-depth exploration of fraud detection techniques using a customized credit card dataset. Leveraging a comprehensive range of Machine Learning (ML) methodologies, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),Logistic Regression. I have implemented and fine-tuned these models to enhance accuracy and effectively identify fraudulent transactions.Used SMOTE to deal with class Imbalance

This repository provides a detailed overview of the data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation steps, offering a comprehensive insight into the methodologies employed.
